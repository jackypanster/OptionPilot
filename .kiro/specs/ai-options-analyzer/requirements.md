# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Options Strategy Analyzer is an MVP tool designed for individual investors familiar with options basics who want to quantify and validate strategy risks and returns before trading. The system enables users to quickly build two-leg options spread strategies, understand their potential risks and rewards through visual analysis, receive AI-powered qualitative analysis, and track paper trading performance through a trading journal.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Integration and Market Connectivity

**User Story:** As an options trader, I want to access real-time stock quotes and options chain data, so that I can build strategies based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to Alpha Vantage API for market data
2. WHEN a user requests stock quotes for predefined symbols (NVDA, TSLA, HOOD, CRCL) THEN the system SHALL return current market prices
3. WHEN a user selects a stock and expiration date THEN the system SHALL retrieve complete options chain data including strikes, call/put types, bid/ask prices
4. IF API connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN options chain data is retrieved THEN it SHALL include all available strike prices, option types, bid prices, and ask prices

### Requirement 2: Strategy Construction and Calculation Engine

**User Story:** As an options trader, I want to build two-leg spread strategies and see immediate calculations of key metrics, so that I can evaluate the strategy's risk-reward profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the strategy builder THEN the system SHALL provide interface to select buy/sell action, call/put type, and strike price for each leg
2. WHEN a user completes strategy construction THEN the system SHALL immediately calculate and display net premium (credit/debit)
3. WHEN strategy is built THEN the system SHALL calculate and display maximum profit potential
4. WHEN strategy is built THEN the system SHALL calculate and display maximum loss potential
5. WHEN strategy is built THEN the system SHALL calculate and display breakeven point(s)
6. WHEN strategy is built THEN the system SHALL calculate margin/cost requirements (max loss for credit spreads, net premium for debit spreads)
7. WHEN strategy is built THEN the system SHALL calculate and display return on margin (max profit / margin)
8. WHEN calculations are complete THEN the system SHALL generate and display a payoff diagram showing profit/loss at different stock prices at expiration

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Strategy Analysis

**User Story:** As an options trader, I want AI analysis of my strategy, so that I can understand the market outlook and key risks in plain language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "AI Analysis" button THEN the system SHALL send strategy details to OpenRouter API using Claude 4 Sonnet model
2. WHEN AI analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL include stock symbol, current stock price, and complete strategy composition in the API call
3. WHEN AI analysis is returned THEN it SHALL provide a one-sentence strategy explanation (e.g., "This is a bullish put credit spread strategy")
4. WHEN AI analysis is returned THEN it SHALL identify the implied market outlook (e.g., "This strategy profits when stock price rises moderately or stays above [price]")
5. WHEN AI analysis is returned THEN it SHALL highlight core risk warnings (e.g., "Maximum loss occurs if stock falls below [price]")
6. IF AI API call fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4: Paper Trading Journal

**User Story:** As an options trader, I want to save my strategies to a trading journal and track their performance, so that I can learn from my paper trading results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes strategy construction THEN the system SHALL provide option to save strategy to trading journal
2. WHEN a strategy is saved THEN the journal SHALL create new entry with all strategy parameters and calculated metrics
3. WHEN viewing trading journal THEN the system SHALL display list with columns: stock symbol, strategy type, entry date, expiration date, net premium, status (open/closed), final P&L
4. WHEN a user selects an open position THEN the system SHALL allow manual entry of closing price or final result
5. WHEN closing data is entered THEN the system SHALL calculate final profit/loss and update position status to closed
6. WHEN journal is accessed THEN it SHALL persist all saved trades across application sessions

### Requirement 5: Technical Implementation Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system built on reliable technical foundations, so that it can be maintained and extended effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN it SHALL use Python as the primary backend language
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use uv for package and virtual environment management
3. WHEN handling API integrations THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and rate limiting
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate local storage mechanisms for MVP scope
5. WHEN calculating options metrics THEN the system SHALL use accurate financial formulas for all computations
